# HexStream #
> For those who are not satisfied with a single stream.

This is a MVP (minimum viable product) project I completed as a student at [Hack Reactor](http://hackreactor.com) in 2 days.

## Summary ##
> This web app allows users to easily watch multiple twitch.tv streams on the same webpage.
Just type in your favorite streamer's username or search for games to start watching.

## Problem ##
> One stream is not enough to satisfy passionate e-sports watchers.

## Solution ##
> This app solves the problem by making it extremely easy to watch multiple streams at once.

## How to Get Started ##
> Go to http://hexstream.shinuesugi.com/ and start watching!
